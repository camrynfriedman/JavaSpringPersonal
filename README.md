Develop an application with NO LESS than 3 tables and NO MORE than 5 tables with relationships (1 to many, many to many, etc.). The reason to keep the database to a minimum of 3 tables is because any less, and the application becomes too trivial. Additionally, the reason to keep the database to a maximum of 5 tables is because any more, and the time spent updating the database due to changes dramatically increases and takes away from development activities and instead becomes a maintenance activity.

The application MUST use DATABASE FIRST (no automatic database generation code). Learning SQL is a vital part of this assignment and you'll be doing yourself a disservice using tooling or language constructs to do the SQL for you.

The application must include AT LEAST one repository and AT LEAST one controller implementing GET, POST, and PUT.
